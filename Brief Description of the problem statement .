For a three-level password system that meets your requirements, you can create a console-based application in Python. 

System Overview
1.)User Authentication Levels:
First Level: Basic password check.
Second Level: Two-factor authentication (e.g., code sent via email/SMS).
Third Level: Security questions or biometric verification (simulated for console-based app).

2.)Features:
Easy to maintain and user-friendly.
Simple interface.
Strong security against bot attacks or hackers.

Steps :
Step 1: Set Up Basic Authentication
step 2: Implement Two-Factor Authentication .For simplicity, simulate the second factor as a code generated by the system.
Step 3: Simulate Security Questions
Step 4: Combine All Levels

This script provides a basic framework for a three-level authentication system:
First Level: Simple username/password check.
Second Level: Simulated two-factor authentication using a code.
Third Level: Basic security question.

Security: In a real-world application, passwords should be hashed and stored securely. Two-factor codes should be generated and verified more securely.
Improvement: For a more robust system, consider integrating with real email/SMS services for the second factor and using a database for storing and verifying credentials securely.
